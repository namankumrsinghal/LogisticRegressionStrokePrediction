# LogisticRegressionStrokePrediction
Built a classification model on predicting whether an individual is expected to have stroke. 

Public dataset on stroke prediction was used in this model.

Feature selection was done through numerical/graphical summaries and ANOVA/ANCOVA(to check which of the remaining features are statistically significant in prediting stroke)

Logistic regression model was built and assessed through ROC curve and the confusion matrix
